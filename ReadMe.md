Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. 
 

A brief summary:

If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
You have been tasked to create a simple version of this game with Python. In your version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 

You should make use of the inbuilt Python module random and its choice method.

Instructions:

"R" for "rock", 
"P" for "paper", 
"S" for "scissors".
When the program is run,  pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
If there is a winner, the winner is displayed, and the program ends. 
If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), the game is restarted from step 3
